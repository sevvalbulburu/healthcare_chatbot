The goal is to design and implement a business-focused chatbot for the healthcare sector.
The chatbot should assist patients and healthcare professionals by answering common
medical queries, providing information about symptoms, and helping users create and list
appointments through messaging.


Your responsibilities are;
- Build an application that implements a healthcare-focused chatbot capable of answering
medical queries and performing actions like appointment booking.
- You can use any frontend technology for the interface (Streamlit or Gradio is required, React
or Vue is a big plus).
- Application MUST have a backend server that integrates with an LLM (OpenAI, Antrophic,
Deepseek, Huggingface Transformers, etc.) and implements Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG).
- The backend must expose REST API endpoints for appointment booking and booking listing.
- The chatbot should integrate with a vector database (Pinecone, Weaviate, or FAISS) to store
and retrieve medical information for RAG functionality. The chatbot must implement toolcalling capabilities using tools like LangChain or Llamaindex to perform actions like
appointment booking or retrieving patient records.
- The application should gracefully handle edge cases and out-of-scope queries with
appropriate fallback responses.
- The Case Study application should be deployed and accessible online (the platform is up to
you).
- Your GitHub Repository for source codes is expected to be shared. (The process will be
reviewed through your commits. Repositories consisting of a single commit will be left out of
the assessment!)
